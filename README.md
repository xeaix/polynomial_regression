## Polynomial Regression

### Description:

This project demonstrates the application of polynomial regression, a supervised learning technique, to predict salary based on position. The dataset includes position levels and corresponding salaries, and the goal is to build a regression model that captures the non-linear relationship between position levels and salaries.

### Objective:

The primary objective is to showcase the use of polynomial regression for predicting salaries, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of how position levels influence compensation. The model's performance is evaluated using the R2 score, providing a measure of its predictive accuracy.

### Key Features:

- Supervised Learning: The project follows a supervised learning paradigm, where the model learns from labeled historical data, associating specific price levels with corresponding volume metrics.
- Polynomial Regression: This regression technique allows us to model non-linear relationships between variables, offering a more accurate representation of the underlying patterns in the data.
- R2 Score Evaluation: The model's performance is assessed using the R2 score, a metric that measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (price) that is predictable from the independent variable (volume). A higher R2 score indicates a better fit of the model to the data.

### How to Use:

1. Dataset: Prepare a dataset containing historical price and volume data. Ensure that the data is structured with clear labels for training and testing.
2. Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data, handling any missing values or outliers, and split it into training and testing sets.
3. Training the Model: Utilize the provided code to train the Polynomial Regression model on the training set. Experiment with the degree of the polynomial to find the optimal fit for your data.
4. Evaluation: Assess the model's performance on the test set using the R2 score. Higher R2 scores indicate a better predictive capability of the model.

### Contributions and Feedback:

Contributions, bug reports, and feedback are highly encouraged. Whether you have suggestions for improving the model, want to report issues, or have ideas for extending its functionality, feel free to submit issues or pull requests.
