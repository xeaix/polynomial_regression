## Polynomial Regression

### Description:

This project demonstrates the application of Polynomial Regression, a supervised learning technique, to predict price based on volume in financial markets. In the realm of regression analysis, this model offers a flexible approach to capturing non-linear relationships between variables, making it particularly valuable for scenarios where a simple linear model falls short.

### Objective:

The primary goal of this project is to showcase how Polynomial Regression can be employed for predicting price movements based on volume data. By training the model on historical data, we aim to capture the nuanced relationships between trading volume and price fluctuations, providing insights that can be valuable for market analysis.

### Key Features:

- Supervised Learning: The project follows a supervised learning paradigm, where the model learns from labeled historical data, associating specific price levels with corresponding volume metrics.
- Polynomial Regression: This regression technique allows us to model non-linear relationships between variables, offering a more accurate representation of the underlying patterns in the data.
- R2 Score Evaluation: The model's performance is assessed using the R2 score, a metric that measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (price) that is predictable from the independent variable (volume). A higher R2 score indicates a better fit of the model to the data.

### How to Use:

1. Dataset: Prepare a dataset containing historical price and volume data. Ensure that the data is structured with clear labels for training and testing.
2. Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data, handling any missing values or outliers, and split it into training and testing sets.
3. Training the Model: Utilize the provided code to train the Polynomial Regression model on the training set. Experiment with the degree of the polynomial to find the optimal fit for your data.
4. Evaluation: Assess the model's performance on the test set using the R2 score. Higher R2 scores indicate a better predictive capability of the model.
